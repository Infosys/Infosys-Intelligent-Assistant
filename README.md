Infosys Intelligent Assistant (IIA) is developed using advanced AI/ML capabilities to significantly increase the productivity of ticket management and resolution process. IIA is trained using historical ticket dump on machine learning algorithms to predict the various fields in the ticket helps in effective ticket management and resolution.
In application maintenance services, teams perform several non-value-adding tasks manually which can lower the productivity of the entire process like reworking tickets after incorrect mapping, validating the information manually to enrich the ticket, expending efforts on known issues due to lack of visibility of related tickets and manual intervention for routine requests like account creation.
IIA can be trained using historical ticket dump based on industry-standard machine learning algorithms (LogisticRegression, XGBoost, RandomForest, Multinominal NB) and can be integrated with ITSM tools to predict the various fields like assignment group, ticket category etc. in a ticket to help in routing the ticket. IIA auto assigns a support engineer to a ticket based on complexity & workload calculator, leave DB, SME mapping and shift roster.
